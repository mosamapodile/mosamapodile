Mogau Mapodile

I am a first year software engineering student at WeThinkCode. My journey started in computer engineering where I spent a lot of time learning how hardware works, but I eventually realized that my heart is in software and the logic behind it. I am also a filmmaker and content creator, so I love combining technical building with visual storytelling.
What I am building

My main focus right now is Cash4Trash. Most people see waste as a problem, but I see it as an untapped resource. I am building this platform using Python to create a direct link between people collecting waste and the facilities that recycle it, making sure everyone gets paid fairly and instantly.
My skills

I spend most of my time working with Python, SQL, and Linux. I am currently learning how to use Django and FastAPI to make my projects more robust. Outside of code, I am experienced in film editing and content strategy, which helps me explain complex technical ideas to anyone.
The goal

I left computer engineering because software allows me to build and test things quickly. My goal is to become a systems architect and build tools that solve real problems in South Africa, starting with the waste industry.
Get in touch

If you want to talk about Python, the circular economy, or even just Naruto lore, feel free to reach out. I am always looking for people to collaborate with on Cash4Trash.
